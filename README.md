# Project_Draupadi
Project Draupadi is a women’s safety and emergency alert system developed for Smart India Hackathon 2025. It combines a low-cost hardware trigger with a Flask-based backend and React frontend to deliver dual alerts—simultaneously notifying trusted contacts and nearby authorities in real time.
